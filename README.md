# Raylib-Zig - Zig + Raylib Template Project

Raylib-Zig is a template project designed to help you quickly start developing your game, application, or graphics project in Zig.

Raylib-Zig does not need any bindings, as the Zig compiler compiles C code natively.

### Instructions

First, clone the project onto your local machine:

Next, update the git submodule containing the Raylib library:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```
You can then build the Zig project with the following command:

```bash
zig build run
```
Have fun.
